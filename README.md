This is a work in progress originally generated by AI. Many patterns are to be replaced with patterns from v9. e.g. focus management. This is not a sample of best practice. Just a learning playground.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **FluentUI v9** - Microsoft's design system
- **Webpack** - Module bundler

## FluentUI v9 Components Used

- Input, Textarea
- Combobox, Dropdown
- Radio, RadioGroup, Checkbox
- Switch, Button
- Slider, SpinButton
- ProgressBar
- Tab, TabList
- Field, Label
- Card, CardHeader
- Dialog, DialogSurface, DialogTitle, DialogContent, DialogActions, DialogBody
- makeStyles (styling)

## Interaction Features

Each tab includes an interactive message area that displays:
- Focus and blur events
- Value changes
- Selection events
- User actions
- Dialog open/close events
- Focus management notifications

### Focus Management
- **Tab Focus Restoration**: When switching between tabs, focus returns to the last focused element in that tab
- **Dialog Focus Control**: When opening the contact dialog, focus automatically moves to the first input field
- **Focus Restoration**: When closing the dialog, focus returns to the element that triggered it

### Contact Dialog
The Basic Inputs tab includes a "Open Contact Dialog" button that demonstrates:
- Modal dialog with form inputs
- Automatic focus management
- Form validation
- Proper dialog dismissal
- Focus restoration to the triggering element

This helps demonstrate the responsive nature of the FluentUI v9 components and provides immediate feedback for testing and learning purposes.
