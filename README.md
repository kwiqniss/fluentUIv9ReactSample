This is a work in progress originally generated by AI. Many patterns are to be replaced with patterns from v9. e.g. focus management. This is not a sample of best practice. Just a learning playground.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **FluentUI v9** - Microsoft's design system
- **Webpack** - Module bundler

## FluentUI v9 Components Used

- **Layout & Navigation**: Tab, TabList, Field, Label
- **Form Controls**: Input, Textarea, Combobox, Dropdown, Radio, RadioGroup, Checkbox, Switch, Button, Slider, SpinButton, ProgressBar
- **Containers**: Card, CardHeader, Dialog, DialogSurface, DialogTitle, DialogContent, DialogActions, DialogBody
- **Theming**: FluentProvider with multiple theme support (webLightTheme, webDarkTheme, teamsLightTheme, teamsDarkTheme, teamsHighContrastTheme)
- **Styling**: makeStyles for CSS-in-JS styling

## Interaction Features

Each tab includes an interactive message area that displays:
- Focus and blur events
- Value changes
- Selection events
- User actions
- Dialog open/close events
- Focus management notifications

### Focus Management
- **Tab Focus Restoration**: When switching between tabs, focus returns to the last focused element in that tab
- **Dialog Focus Control**: When opening the contact dialog, focus automatically moves to the first input field
- **Focus Restoration**: When closing the dialog, focus returns to the element that triggered it

### Contact Dialog
The Basic Inputs tab includes a "Open Contact Dialog" button that demonstrates:
- Modal dialog with form inputs
- Automatic focus management
- Form validation
- Proper dialog dismissal
- Focus restoration to the triggering element

This helps demonstrate the responsive nature of the FluentUI v9 components and provides immediate feedback for testing and learning purposes.

## Theme System

The application supports dynamic theme switching with 5 built-in FluentUI v9 themes:

- **Web Light**: Default light theme optimized for web applications
- **Web Dark**: Dark theme variant for web applications  
- **Teams Light**: Microsoft Teams light theme styling
- **Teams Dark**: Microsoft Teams dark theme styling
- **High Contrast**: Accessible high-contrast theme for better visibility

### Theme Features
- **Real-time switching**: Themes change immediately when selected
- **Persistent selection**: Your theme choice is saved in browser localStorage
- **Responsive design**: Theme selector adapts to mobile layouts
- **Accessibility**: High contrast theme provides enhanced visibility
- **Consistent styling**: All components automatically adapt to the selected theme

The theme selector is positioned to the right of the tab navigation on desktop and below the tabs on mobile devices.
